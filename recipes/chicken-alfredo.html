        </ul>
        Steps:
        <ol>
            <lil>Cook the pasta just until al dente. Season chicken with olive oil, herbs, and spices.</lil>
            <lil>Cook chicken in a large saute pan for about 4-7 minutes per side or until a golden brown crust forms on the outside and the chicken is cooked 
                through on the inside. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes, then slice.</lil>
            <lil>Cut butter into 8 slices, add to the large skillet, and reduce heat to low. Add garlic and cook for 30-60 seconds, stirring frequently. 
                Do not allow garlic to brown!</lil>
            <lil>Whisk in heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat.</lil>
            <lil>Reduce heat to low or medium-low and simmer gently (do not boil!), whisking frequently, for about 3-4 minutes or until it thickens slightly. 
                It should easily coat the back of a spoon.</lil>
            <lil>Remove the pan from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</lil>
            <lil>Stir until the cheese melts.</lil>
            <lil>Add cooked pasta and toss to coat evenly. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</lil>
            <lil>Add chicken and return to medium-low heat for a couple minutes or until everything is warmed through.</lil>
            <lil>Garnish with chopped parsley (and a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like) and serve!</lil>
        </ol>
