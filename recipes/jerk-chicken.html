        <li>5 medium scallions</li>
        <li>1/2 medium yellow onion</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 (2-inch) piece ginger</li>
        <li>10 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole allspice berries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gravy master or Grace browning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
       </ul>
       Steps:
       <ol>
        <li>Prepare the following, placing each in a blender as you complete it: Trim and coarsely chop 5 medium scallions and 
            1/2 medium yellow onion. Peel 5 garlic cloves. Peel and finely grate 1 (2-inch piece) ginger until you 
            have 1 tablespoon.</li>
        <li>Add 10 fresh thyme sprigs (including stems), 2 whole scotch bonnet peppers, 1/4 cup whole allspice berries, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 
            2 tablespoons all-purpose seasoning, 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar, 1 tablespoon gravy master or Grace browning, 
            1 tablespoon kosher salt, 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper, 2 teaspoons onion powder, and 2 teaspoons smoked paprika. 
            Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat 6 whole chicken legs dry with paper towels. Use the tip of a knife to make a few short slits about 1/2-inch deep on both sides of each leg, keeping the skin in one piece and not cutting all the way through to the bone. 
            Add to the marinade and massage the marinade into the chicken with your hands, getting some it into the slits. 
            Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ºF. Meanwhile, let the chicken sit at room temperature. 
            Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken legs skin-side up on the baking sheet; discard the remaining marinade. Tent the chicken very loosely with aluminum foil, making sure it does not touch the chicken.</li>
        <li>Roast for 1 hour. Uncover and roast for 15 to 20 minutes more. If desired, broil the chicken on the lowest setting for the last 5 minutes until charred in spots for a darker color.</li>
       </ol>
